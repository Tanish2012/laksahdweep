<h1 align=center> RAFTING <br> <br>
<h2> <p align=justify> <tt> Rafting is an exhilarating outdoor activity that involves navigating rivers or other bodies of water on an inflatable raft. This adventurous sport is popular among thrill-seekers who enjoy the combination of teamwork, skill, and adrenaline rushes of challenging river rapids. Rafting can range from serene, scenic floats on gentle waters to intense, heart-pounding rides through turbulent whitewater rapids, making it accessible for beginners and experts alike. Participants must often work together to manoeuvre the raft, synchronise paddling, and respond to the guide's commands to ensure safety and maximise the fun. Beyond the excitement, rafting offers a unique way to experience the natural beauty of river landscapes, fostering a deep appreciation for the environment and the great outdoors. </tt> </h2>
